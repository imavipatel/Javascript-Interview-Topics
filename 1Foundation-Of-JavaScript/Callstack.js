Call Stack : The call stack is a fundamental concept in javascript(interpreter) that 
manages the execution of function calls. It is a stack data
structure that keeps track of the function call in a program,
enusring that they are executed in correct order.

How the call stack works:

1. Function Invocation: When a function is called, it is added to the
top of the call stack.

2. Execution: The javascript engine executes the function at the top
of the stack.

3. Function Completion: When the function completes, it is removed from
the top of the stack.

4. Return to caller: Control returns to the function that called the
completed function, which is now at the top of the stack

Example:

Consider the following code:

*/

function firstFunction() {
    console.log("First Function");
    secondFunction();
    console.log("First Function End");
}

function secondFunction() {
    console.log("Second Function");
    thirdFunction();
    console.log("Second Function End");
}

function thirdFunction() {
    console.log("Third Function");
}

firstFunction();

/*
Call Stack Execution:
1. Initial Call: firstFunction() is called and added to the call stack.
Call Stack: [firstFunction]

2. Inside firstFunction:
Logs "First Function".
Calls secondFunction(), which is added to the call stack.
Call Stack: [firstFunction, secondFunction]

3. Inside secondFunction:
Logs "Second Function".
Calls thirdFunction(), which is added to the call stack.
Call Stack: [firstFunction, secondFunction, thirdFunction]

4. Inside thirdFunction:
Logs "Third Function".
thirdFunction completes and is removed from the call stack.
Call Stack: [firstFunction, secondFunction]

5. Back to secondFunction:
Logs "Second Function End".
secondFunction completes and is removed from the call stack.
Call Stack: [firstFunction]

6. Back to firstFunction:
Logs "First Function End".
firstFunction completes and is removed from the call stack.
Call Stack: []

Output: 

First Function
Second Function
Third Function
Second Function End
First Function End

Key Points:

1. LIFO(Last In, First Out): The call stack operates on a LIFO principle, meaning the last function added is
the first to be executed and removed.

2. Stack Overflow: If the call stack grows too large, typically due to excessive recursion, it can result in
a "Stack Overflow" error.

3. Single Threaded: JavaScript is single threaded, meaning it has one call stack
and executes one piece of code at a time.

The call stack is crucial for understanding how JavaScript manages function 
execution and handles synchronous code.
