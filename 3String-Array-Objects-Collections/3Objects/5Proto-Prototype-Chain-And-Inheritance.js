📌 PROTOTYPE, __proto__, PROTOTYPE CHAIN & INHERITANCE
=====================================================

📝 DETAILED THEORY:
-----------------------------------------------------
1. What is a Prototype?
- In JavaScript, every object is linked to another object called its "prototype".
- The prototype acts like a fallback object → if JS doesn’t find a property/method on the object, it searches in its prototype.
- This mechanism is called PROTOTYPAL INHERITANCE.

2. __proto__ (Dunder Proto)
- Every object in JS has a hidden property called `__proto__`.
- It is a reference to the prototype from which that object is inherited.
- You can access it directly (not recommended in production, but useful for learning/debugging).

3. Prototype Property (on Functions)
- Functions in JS automatically get a `prototype` property.
- When you use a function as a constructor (`new` keyword), the created object’s `__proto__` points to the function’s `prototype`.

4. Prototype Chain
- When you try to access a property on an object:
   - JS looks inside the object.
   - If not found, it goes to the object’s prototype (`__proto__`).
   - If still not found, it keeps moving up until `Object.prototype`.
   - If nothing is found even there → returns `undefined`.
- This lookup path is called the "Prototype Chain".

5. End of Prototype Chain
- The chain ends at `Object.prototype.__proto__` which is `null`.

6. Inheritance
- JS uses prototypes to implement inheritance.
- With ES6, `class` and `extends` were introduced → but internally they still use prototypes.

-----------------------------------------------------
🔹 PART 1: __proto__
-----------------------------------------------------
*/

const person = {
  greet: function () {
    console.log("Hello from person");
  },
};

const student = {
  name: "Avi",
};

// Link student to person
student.__proto__ = person;

student.greet(); // ✅ "Hello from person" (inherited from prototype)

console.log(student.__proto__ === person); // true

/*  
-----------------------------------------------------
🔹 PART 2: Prototype Chain
-----------------------------------------------------
*/

console.log(student.__proto__ === person); // true
console.log(person.__proto__ === Object.prototype); // true
console.log(Object.prototype.__proto__); // null

/*  
-----------------------------------------------------
🔹 PART 3: Function Prototypes
-----------------------------------------------------
*/

function Animal(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

// Shared method for all Animal objects
Animal.prototype.speak = function () {
  console.log(`${this.name} makes a sound`);
};

const dog = new Animal("Dog");
dog.speak(); // ✅ "Dog makes a sound" (inherited from Animal.prototype)

/*  
-----------------------------------------------------
🔹 PART 4: Class Inheritance (syntactic sugar)
-----------------------------------------------------
*/

class Car {
  drive() {
    console.log("Driving a car...");
  }
}

class Tesla extends Car {
  autopilot() {
    console.log("Self-driving mode enabled 🚗🤖");
  }
}

const myCar = new Tesla();
myCar.drive(); // ✅ Inherited from Car
myCar.autopilot(); // ✅ Defined in Tesla

❓ Q&A (Interview Style)
-----------------------------------------------------

Q1: What is __proto__ in JavaScript?
👉 It's a reference to the prototype object from which another object inherits.

Q2: What’s the difference between prototype and __proto__?
👉 - prototype → property of constructor functions/classes (used for inheritance).
   - __proto__ → property of objects, points to their prototype.

Q3: How does the prototype chain work?
👉 If a property is not found on the object, JS looks into its __proto__. This continues until `null`.

Q4: What is the end of the prototype chain?
👉 null (after `Object.prototype.__proto__`).

Q5: How does inheritance work in JavaScript?
👉 Objects/classes inherit properties and methods via prototypes or the `extends` keyword.

-----------------------------------------------------
⭐ QUICK SUMMARY:
- `__proto__` links objects to their prototype.
- `prototype` is used on functions/constructors to share methods.
- Prototype Chain = property lookup path.
- Inheritance in JS is prototype-based (classes are sugar).
